# Semantic HTML Homework

## The Brief

You work for a consultancy firm who have been hired by the hoxton hotels group to create their website.

The client's design team has provided you with a reference image and the client has started the HTML markup. They need you to finish the markup.

You will find the work that they have done already [here][2]

You should copy this into your `~/dev/HOMEWORK/intro-to-html/index.html` file.

They have expressed that they want to make sure their hard of sight customers have a good experience when browsing their website. They have specified that the submitted work must **not include any CSS or JavaScript**.

All of the assets are included [here][1]
There's no need to download them, just right click on the image and select copy image address.
